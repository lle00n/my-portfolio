My focus was on iOS development with Swift/SwiftUI, Objective-C and Xcode. I also gained experience in Android development with Kotlin and Java.\nAs a team, we worked according to the Scrum method. I was also able to further develop my skills in automated and manual UI testing. In this context, I also came into contact with CI/CD pipelines in GitLab, which ensured the functionality of the code during both continuous development and releases."
